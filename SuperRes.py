#%% Superres.py

# Gift from the shiny new version of Bing!

# Request:
# Write a python script that makes a superresolution image from a stack of images by doing the following: 
# Import all .jpg images in a folder (the folder path should be an input). 
# Upscale those images by 200% using the nearest neighbor method. 
# Align all of the images. 
# Average the stack of images using the median method. 
# Apply a 200% sharpening filter to the averaged image with a 2 pixel radius. 
# Finally, export the sharpened image to a .png named "SUPERRES.png" in the same folder the image stack was imported from.

# Bing's comments:
# Here is a Python script that should do what youâ€™re asking for:
# ...
# You can use this function by calling superresolution(folder_path) where folder_path is the path to the folder containing your stack of .jpg images. 
# This script uses OpenCV library for image processing. 
# Make sure you have it installed before running this script.
